Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game in a web browser.

You can visit the deployed version of the project https://tic-tac-toe-by-utkarsh-bansal.netlify.app/.

How to implement
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The game will display a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
Player 1 (X) starts the game by clicking on an empty cell on the grid.
Player 2 (O) takes their turn by clicking on another empty cell.
Players take turns alternately until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
A player wins by getting three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.
If all cells are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.
To restart the game, click on the "Restart" button.
